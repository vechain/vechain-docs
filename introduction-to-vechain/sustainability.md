# Sustainability and VeChain

## VeChain's Approach to Global Sustainability

In addressing the world's most pressing sustainability challenges, VeChain recognizes the need for collective, global action. Our mission is to amplify individual efforts, creating a powerful synergy that can effectively combat climate change, environmental degradation, and social inequities.

We aim to empower individuals to engage with sustainability in their daily lives by providing tools and platforms that enable informed, impactful decisions. Our focus areas include access to healthy food, clean water, and fresh air - fundamental elements of human existence and well-being.

## VeChain: A Sustainable Blockchain Ecosystem

For our ecosystem to be sustainable, the infrastructure itself must first be sustainable. The VeChainThor blockchain offers an energy-efficient, user-friendly, open platform for collaboration.

VeChainThor features a new Proof of Authority mechanism – PoA 2.0, that strikes a much-desired balance between speed and security. The result? Scalability and lower energy consumption, making it the ideal blockchain to jumpstart sustainability initiatives.

Over the years, several assessments have demonstrated the network's energy efficiency, but we’ll let the numbers speak for themselves. The 2022 carbon footprint of VeChain’s network of 101 authorities masternodes was calculated to be 4.46 t CO2e/year, ranking VeChain as one of the most energy efficient blockchains, using just 0,000216 kWh of electricity per transaction, or roughly 0.04% of other blockchains.

We have and are continuing to engage with many businesses and industries to combine forces and create innovative solutions to promote sustainability in many different forms. Our ambition is to become the most sustainable blockchain networks and ecosystems.

## Web3 and Blockchain: Catalysts for Sustainability

We have the vision and cutting edge technology to silently shape society in ways yet not imagined:

* **Collective Governance & Decision-Making**: Blockchain enables inclusive and transparent decision-making through decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Instead of top down decisions, blockchains can offer more equitable decisions to questions that impact us all.
* **Tokenisation & Incentivization**: Web3 is a key driver of the sustainability transition will be a fundamental redefinition of “value” as a concept. Web3 technologies enable us to understand, qualify, quantify, and share the value of an action, including its societal, environmental, and economic factors.
* **Transparency & Accountability**: Web3 provides people with a basis to trust that enterprises and institutions will uphold their sustainability commitments, that corporate and governmental reports and communications on sustainability initiatives are substantiated, and that technology companies are tracking and selling user data properly.
* **Efficient Resource Management**: Optimizes resource allocation and usage through smart contracts and decentralized applications, reducing waste and improving efficiency.

By leveraging these capabilities, VeChain is at the forefront of integrating blockchain technology with sustainability initiatives, driving meaningful change on a global scale.&#x20;

We imagine a future where our systems are interwoven in a way that creates trust, efficiency, and optimal decision making. Saving our planet is the most pressing challenge of our time.
