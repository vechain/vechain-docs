# VeChain Token (VET)

| VET Characteristics | Details           |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Type                | Native Coin       |
| Precision           | 18 decimal places |
| Total supply        | 86,712,634,466    |

## Native Coin: The Backbone of VeChainThor

A native coin is the primary cryptocurrency inherent to a specific blockchain network. As VeChainThor's native coin, VET serves as the fundamental unit of value and plays multiple crucial roles within the ecosystem:

* **Medium of Exchange**: Facilitates value transfer within the network.
* **Store of Value**: Acts as a digital asset that can appreciate or depreciate in value.
* **Utility Token**: Enables access to various features and services on the VeChainThor blockchain.
* **Governance Mechanism**: VET holders can participate in network governance decisions.

## VET's High Divisibility: 18 Decimal Places

VET's high divisibility, with 18 decimal places, offers several advantages:

* **Micropayments**: Enables extremely small transactions, crucial for many blockchain applications.
* **Precision**: Allows for exact value representation in various use cases.
* **Scalability**: Supports a wide range of transaction sizes, from tiny micropayments to large transfers.
* **Future-proofing**: Provides room for value appreciation without limiting usability.

The smallest unit of VET, similar to Bitcoin's Satoshi, and just like in Ethereum, is called 'wei':
1 VET = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei (10^18 wei).

This high divisibility makes VET particularly suitable for:

* Internet of Things (IoT) applications
* Micro-incentivization in sustainability initiatives
* Precise value allocation in complex supply chain scenarios

## Total Supply: Fixed at 86,712,634,466 VET

The total supply of VET is fixed, meaning no new tokens will ever be created. This fixed supply model offers several benefits:

* **Scarcity**: Creates a deflationary aspect to the token economics.
* **Predictability**: Allows for more accurate long-term economic modeling.
* **Transparency**: Provides clarity to users and investors about the token's distribution.
* **Value Proposition**: Can potentially drive value appreciation as demand increases against a fixed supply.

## Implications of a Fixed Supply

* **Long-term Value**: As adoption grows, the fixed supply could lead to appreciation in VET's value.
* **Economic Stability**: Prevents inflationary pressures that come with an ever-increasing supply.
* **Trust**: Builds confidence among users and investors due to the predictable token economics.

By combining high divisibility with a fixed total supply, VET is designed to serve as a versatile and sustainable utility token within the VeChainThor ecosystem. This design supports a wide range of applications, from microtransactions in IoT devices to large-scale enterprise solutions, while maintaining a stable and predictable economic model.
