# Introduction to VeChain

## What is VeChain?

VeChain, headquartered in San Marino, Europe, is a pioneering blockchain ecosystem and creator of VeChainThor, a world-class smart contract platform driving real-world blockchain adoption. Founded in 2015 by Sunny Lu, VeChain has consistently worked to deliver a transparent, efficient, scalable, and adaptable blockchain solution.

Since its inception, VeChain has established itself as a leader in the blockchain space, forging partnerships with renowned organizations such as Walmart China, BMW, DNV, and the government of San Marino. VeChain's current mission is to build digital ecosystems that drive global sustainability and digital transformation.

## Why choose VeChain?

The VeChainThor blockchain is engineered for mass adoption, offering several key advantages:

* **Scalability**: Innovative transaction model supporting asynchronous operations and transaction lifecycle dependencies.
* **Cost Predictability**: Unique dual-token model ensures stable transaction fees during high-demand periods.
* **Sustainable Consensus**: Proof of Authority (PoA) mechanism provides security and scalability with a minimal carbon footprint.
* **Fee Delegation**: Enables sponsor accounts to cover transaction fees, lowering barriers to entry for new users.
* **Robust Security**: Zero reported hacks of the PoA consensus mechanism since inception.
* **High Reliability**: Uninterrupted operation since the genesis block in 2018.
* **Interoperability**: Compatible with other leading blockchain platforms.

## VeChain Governance

VeChain embodies true decentralization, operating as an open, public network without centralized control. The ecosystem thrives on community support and promotion. Strategic direction is provided by a steering committee and the VeChain Foundation, ensuring the network's growth aligns with its core mission and values.
