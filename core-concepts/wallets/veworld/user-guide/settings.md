**Currency Format**  

You can choose how the fiat value of your assets appears in the wallet.  

- **Comma:** Uses a comma as a separator for the decimal value (e.g., 9.999,99).  
- **Dot:** Uses a dot as a separator for the decimal value (e.g., 9,999.99).  
- **System:** Uses your device's system settings to automatically set the preference based on your region.  

**Symbol Position**  

You can choose where the €/$ symbol is displayed in relation to the fiat value of your assets.  

- **Before amount:** The symbol appears before the amount (e.g., $9999).  
- **After amount:** The symbol appears after the amount (e.g., 9999$).  

**Theme**

You can anytime switch between the dark or light theme, or just use your device settings.

🚨 **Dev Alert**

To create a more immersive and consistent user experience, when opening a dApp from VeWorld mobile, we have implemented a way to provide the current language preference of VeWorld to the dApp. There are two ways to retrieve this information, depending on whether your app is **server-side rendered (SSR)** or **client-side rendered (CSR, non-SSR)**.

**Server side rendered (SSR) Apps**

If your application is SSR, you can obtain the language preference from the `Accept-Language` header. This will provide the current locale set in VeWorld.  

**Client-Side Rendered (CSR) / Frontend Apps (Non-SSR)**

If your application its not SSR, to get access to the current language used in VeWorld you can do it simply using the **injected JavaScript property** that you can get it using window.vechain.acceptLanguage.


**Reset**

You can hard reset your wallet, and clear all your local data.
This action cannot be reverted.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are going to reset your wallet without your backups properly saved, you'll loose access to all your assets.
