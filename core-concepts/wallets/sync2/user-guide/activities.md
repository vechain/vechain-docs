{% hint style="info" %}

- Transaction required 12 blocks to be confirmed.
{% endhint %}

### Completed <a href="#completed" id="completed"></a>

* **Confirmed**: Transaction has been confirmed more than 12 blocks or signed a certificate.
* **Expired**: The transaction reached the limit of expiration or the VTHO is not enough to compute the transaction.
* **Reverted**: Several reasons may cause the transaction to revert.

{% hint style="info" %}
- Reverted transaction will deduct the VTHO due to vm(virtual machine) computed
- All the signed transactions/certificates are **stored in local**, therefore, it only shows the transaction/content which you signed on the device.
