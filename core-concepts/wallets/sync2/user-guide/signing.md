## Content type <a href="#content-type" id="content-type"></a>

There are two major types of signing contents:

| Type        | Purpose                                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Transaction | **Create** / **Transfer** / **Contract Call** |
| Certificate | **Identification** / **Agreement**            |

{% hint style="info" %}
Sync2 would not provide the list of your address unless you sign the certificate of identification. Moreover, it only provides the address you've signed to dApp rather than all the addresses.
