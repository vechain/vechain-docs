## Create password <a href="#create-password" id="create-password"></a>

The password allows you to access Sync2 and unlock your wallet. If you forget the password, you will **not** be able to access Sync2. You will need to delete the app and restore the wallet.

## Back up wallet <a href="#back-up-wallet" id="back-up-wallet"></a>

Once the wallet is created, we recommend you back up the wallet immediately

The mnemonic words store all the information needed at any point in time to recover your wallet. Please back up your wallet once the wallet is created.

{% hint style="info" %}
The mnemonic must be stored in a secure place, preferably offline. The mnemonic allows you to regain wallet access in a scenario where your device is lost, stolen, or unusable due to any reason.
{% endhint %}
