## Description

The first group or errors that we will discuss is called "Hardhat Specific" errors. These errors occur due to the fact that they expect features that are not available on a normal blockchain node. Since when running the tests on VeChain we are using the `thor` node it is expected to not be able to use the hardhat specific features. In the next section we will explore the two types of hardhat specific failures that we have encountered.
