# Block Explorers

## What is a block explorer?

A block explorer is an online tool that enables you to search for real-time and historical information about a blockchain, including data related to blocks, transactions, addresses and more. It is commonplace for blockchain wallets to link to a reputable block explorer once a user transaction has been executed. This process provides a user with a second level of validation, where they can instantly validate the status of a transaction, executed from a wallet, on a trusted, independent tool.

It's not uncommon to have multiple tools satisfying the same requirement in blockchain ecosystems. In fact, as explorers play such a critical role in making blockchain data accessible to everyone, having multiple tools is actually a good thing.

## Why use a block explorer?

Block explorers are useful to many different types of actor for various reasons.

* Check the status of a transaction.
* Review previous transactions.
* View the contents of a wallet, such as transaction history or token balance.
* View the state of the blockchain via the current block height, transaction volume, transaction fees.
* View the market data associated with a token such as the circulating supply of a token, the max supply and market capitalization.
