# Transaction Model

VeChainThor defines a [transaction ](https://github.com/vechain/thor/blob/master/tx/transaction.go)in Golang as:

```go
// transaction.go

type Transaction struct {
	body body
}

type body struct {
	ChainTag     byte			
	BlockRef     uint64
	Expiration   uint32
	Clauses      []*Clause
	GasPriceCoef uint8
	Gas          uint64
	DependsOn    *thor.Bytes32 `rlp:"nil"`
	Nonce        uint64
	Reserved     reserved
	Signature    []byte
}
```

Fields within the transaction `body`, $$\Omega$$ , are defined as:

* `ChainTag` – last byte of the genesis block ID which is used to identify a blockchain to prevent the cross-chain replay attack;
* `BlockRef` - reference to a specific block;
* `Expiration` – how long, in terms of the number of blocks, the transaction will be allowed to be mined in VeChainThor;
* `Clauses` – an array of _Clause_ objects each of which contains fields `To`, `Value` and `Data` to enable a single transaction to carry multiple tasks issued by the transaction sender;
* `GasPriceCoef` – coefficient used to calculate the gas price for the transaction.
* `Gas` – maximum amount of gas allowed to pay for the transaction;
* `DependsOn` – ID of the transaction on which the current transaction depends;
* `Nonce` – a random number set by the wallet / user;
* `Reserved` - _reserved_ Object contains two fields: `Features` and `Unused`.
  * `Feature` as 32-bit unsigned integer and default set as `0`.For Designated Gas Payer (VIP-191) must be set as `1`
  * `Unused` an array of reserved field for backward compatibility, it **MUST** be set as an empty array for now otherwise the transaction will be considered invalid.
* `Signature` - transaction signature, $$sig = sign(hash(rlp\lbrace\Omega - sig \rbrace), sk))$$,where $$sk$$ is the transaction sender's private key.
