# Index with Graph Node

[The Graph's Nodes](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/README.md) are an essential component for developers working with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based blockchains. They enable efficient querying and indexing of blockchain data, allowing developers to build and deploy subgraphs that define how to map and retrieve data from a blockchain. By using Graph Node's, developers can create powerful and scalable decentralized applications (dApps) that can quickly access and process blockchain data.

VeChain does not have direct RPC compatibility, but the SDK and other tools can provide a translator to make it easy to connect and access data instantly.

This section describes the steps required to set up a Graph Node that indexes different silos of information.
