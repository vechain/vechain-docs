# Best Practices for Developing on VeChainThor

* Prioritize the RESTful API: For optimal performance and integration.
* Use VeChainThor-Specific Libraries: vechain-sdk-js are essential.
* Master Multi-Clause/Multi-Task Transactions: Leverage MCT/MTT for efficiency.
* Manage VET and VTHO: Understand the dual-token system and ensure sufficient balances.
* Refer to the Official Documentation: The VeChainThor documentation is the definitive source of truth.
* Test Thoroughly: Always test on the testnet before deploying to the mainnet.
