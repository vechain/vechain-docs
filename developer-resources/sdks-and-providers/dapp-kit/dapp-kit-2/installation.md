# Installation

We suggest starting with one of the [example apps](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-dapp-kit/tree/main/examples) so:\
\
\- You have a working example\
\- You don't have to strive with node polyfills

However, if you can't, proceed with the manual installation below.

## Manual Installation

{% hint style="warning" %}
dApp-kit has been built on top of Connex, which will require crypto, buffer, http, https and some other node polyfills, check [example app](https://github.com/vechain/vechain-dapp-kit/tree/main/examples) configuration files if you are stuck. Check also [Node Polyfills page](https://app.gitbook.com/s/HKk8xWsgscVhGUM2fb7S/developer-resources/sdks-and-providers/dapp-kit/dapp-kit-1/node-polyfills).
{% endhint %}

* **React**: in case your project uses React or React-compatible framework like Remix and Next\
  \
  check the [React Documentation](react/installation.md)
* **Other Frameworks**: in case your project is not using React, you can still use the dApp-kit with the Vanilla JS implementation\
  \
  check the [Vanilla JS Documentation](vanilla/installation.md)
