# DevPal

[Devpal](https://github.com/libotony/devpal#readme) is a set of tools to assist developers when developing and testing locally using a Thor Solo Node. Devpal contains two tools:

* [Insight](https://insight.vecha.in/): a serverless VeChain explorer. It allows you to explore and search for blocks, transactions, and accounts. With support for both the VeChainThor mainnet and testnet.
* [Inspector](https://inspector.vecha.in/): a tool that allows you to deploy and interact with the contract.
